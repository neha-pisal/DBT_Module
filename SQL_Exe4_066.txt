EXERCISE NO. 4 :-

1. Display the minimum Status in the Supplier table.
-> select min(status) "Minimum Status" from S;
      
2. Display the maximum Weight in the Parts table. 
->  select max(weight) "Maximum Weight" from P;
     
3. Display the average Weight of the Parts.  
-> select avg(weight) "Average Weight" from P;
    
4. Display the total Quantity sold for part ‘P1’.
->  select sum(Qty) from spj where `P#` = 'p1';
      
5. Display the total Quantity sold for each part. 
->  select `p#`, sum(Qty) from spj group by `p#`;
    
 6. Display the average Quantity sold for each part. 
->  select `p#`, avg(Qty) from spj group by `p#`;
     
7. Display the maximum Quantity sold for each part, provided the maximum Quantity is greater than 800.      
->  select `p#`, max(Qty) from spj group by `p#`; 

8. Display the Status and the count of Suppliers with that Status.  
-> select Status, count(*) "Count of Suppliers" from S GROUP BY status;
    
9. Display the count of Projects going on in different cities.
->  select City, count(*) "Count of Project" from P GROUP BY City;  

10. What is the difference between COUNT(Status) and COUNT(*) ?
-> COUNT(*) function will return all the rows including duplicates and NULL values
    but
   COUNT(Status) does not include it because count(columnname) excludes NULL values.  
      
11. Display the Status and the Count of Suppliers with that Status in the following format as shown below:-        

	Status   Count     
	Ten   	  1     
	Twenty    2     
	Thirty    3 

->    select case
      when Status = 10 Then 'Ten'
      when Status = 20 Then 'Twenty'
      when Status = 30 Then 'Thirty'
      when Status = 40 Then 'Fourty'
      when Status = 50 Then 'Fifty'
      when Status = 60 Then 'Sixty'
      end
      Status, count(Status) Count from S GROUP BY status;
