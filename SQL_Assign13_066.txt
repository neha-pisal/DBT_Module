ASSIGNMENT NO. 13 :-

1) Create a union of two queries that shows the names, cities, and ratings of all 
  customers. Those with rating of 200 or greater will also have the words 
  “High Rating”, while the others will have the words “Low Rating”. 
->  select cname, city, rating "High Ratings", NULL "Low Ratings" from customers where rating >= 200
    UNION
    select cname, city, NULL, rating from customers d where rating < 200;

2) Write a command that produces the name and number of each salesperson and each 
  customer with more than one current order. Put the results in alphabetical order. 
-> select orders.Cnum Number, Cname Name, count(orders.Cnum) total from orders,customers where orders.Cnum = customers.Cnum GROUP BY orders.cnum HAVING total > 1
   UNION
   select orders.Snum, Sname, count(orders.Snum) total from orders,salespeople where orders.Snum = Salespeople.Snum GROUP BY Snum HAVING total > 1 ORDER BY 2;

3) Form a union of three queries. Have the first select the snums of all salespeople 
   in San Jose; the second, the cnums of all customers in San Jose; and the third the
   onums of all orders on October 3. Retain duplicates between the last two queries 
   but eliminate any redundancies between either of them and the first.   
   (Note: in the sample tables as given, there would be no such redundancy. This is besides the point.) 
->  select Snum Number from salespeople where city = 'San Jose'
    UNION
    select Cnum from customers where city = 'San Jose'
    UNION
    select Onum from orders where Odate = '1990-10-03';
