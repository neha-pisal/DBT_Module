ASSIGNMENT NO. 16 :-

1) Write a command that will enable a user to pull orders grouped by date 
   out of the Orders table quickly. 
-> create index onum_odate on orders(onum,odate);

2) If the Orders table has already been created, how can you force the onum field to be unique (assume all current values are unique)? 
-> create unique index i_onum on orders(onum);

3) Create an index that would permit each salesperson to retrieve his or her orders grouped by date quickly. 
-> create index i_snum_odate on orders(snum,odate);
 
4) Let us assume that each salesperson is to have only one customer of a given rating, and that this is currently the case. 
   Enter a command that enforces it. 
->  create index i_rating_snum on customers(cnum, rating, snum);

//show indexes from customers;
